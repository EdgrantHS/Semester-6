    "# Case Study 6: Autonomous Drone Delivery System\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background:\n",
    "\n",
    "With the rise of e-commerce, companies are exploring autonomous drone delivery systems to improve delivery speed and reduce costs. However, operating drones in urban or rural environments presents challenges such as avoiding obstacles, adapting to weather conditions, and managing battery life.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "Design a computational solution to optimize drone delivery routes. The solution should consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Real-time data (e.g., weather conditions, air traffic, and battery levels).\n",
    "2. Obstacle avoidance and safe navigation.\n",
    "3. Delivery priorities (e.g., urgent packages).\n",
    "4. Energy efficiency and battery life optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to create a system that dynamically plans and adjusts delivery routes for autonomous drones based on real-time data while balancing delivery speed, energy efficiency, and safety. Additionally, your solution must incorporate at least one classic algorithm we have learned, such as linear search, finding extreme values, greedy algorithm, or brute force."
